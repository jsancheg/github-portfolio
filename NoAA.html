        <h2> Context </h2>
        <p> The week of 14-Jul-2025 feels like one of the hotest in the UK. 
            This event spaks my curiosity about public data that contains records of 
            sea and atmospheric temperatures around the world. National Oceanic 
            and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides global 
            temperatures records that can be used to analsys the 
            average temperature around the world.  
        </p>

        <h2> Project </h2>
        <p>
        The goal is to create a heatmap visualization 
        of the average temperature around the world 
        between 14-Jul-2025 and 20-Jul-2025.
        </p>


        <h2> Techniques </h2>
        <p>
        The code shows how to use the National Oceanic 
         and Atmospheric Administration NOAA's
        API to extract global temperature data 
        to create a heatmap visualization of 
        the average temperature around the world.
        The code uses the <code> requests </code> 
        library to make a GET request to the NOAA's 
        API and retrieve the temperature data. 
        The data is then processed to extract the 
        relevant information, such as the date, 
        latitude, longitude, and temperature.
        The data is then used to create a heatmap 
        visualization.

        The main libraries used to create the heatmap 
        were  <code> cartopy </code> and <code> 
        matplotlib </code>. 
        
        The <code> cartopy </code> library was used to
        create the map projection and to plot the
        temperature data on the map. The <code> matplotlib </code>
        library was used to create the heatmap visualization.
        The data was filtered to include only the records
        from 14-Jul-2025 to 20-Jul-2025, and the average
        temperature was calculated for each geographical
        location. The heatmap was then created using the
        <code>imshow</code> function from <code> 
        matplotlib </code>. 
        
        </p>





        <h2>Results & Impact </h2>
        <p>
        The heat map below shows that areas located 
        near the Equator experience temperatures 
        between 30 and 40 degrees celsius, while 
        areas located in the poles experience 
        temperatures between -10 and 10 degrees celsius. 
        The average temperature in the UK was around 
        20 degrees celsius during this week. 
        </p>

    <p>
        A possible extension of this project is 
        to create the same visuabliation for 
        the UK only, or to create a time series 
        visualization of the average 
        temperature in the UK over a 
        longer period of time, such as a year 
        or a decade. This would allow to see 
        how the average temperature has changed 
        over time and to identify trends and 
        patterns in the data.
